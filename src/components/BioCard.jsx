        It seems that the easiest way to describe someone's personal identity is
        through their life experiences. Hopefully this page can do that!

        I believe that two things are key to defining a person: 1. Their life
        experiences 2. Their reactions to their life experiences

      <h1>Bio / Background</h1>
      <hr />

      <p>
        Over 20 years ago, I was born in a small village of farms in coastal
        Andhra Pradesh. My early years were spent mostly with extended family as
        my parents were often working, but all that changed when my dad was
        offered the opportunity to come to the United States. We landed in
        Cincinnati, Ohio where I spent the rest of my childhood, barring regular
        trips back home. From a young age, I assimilated into American culture,
        though my Indian heritage is still important to me. I am
        still fluent in my native language (Telugu) and a practicing Hindu,
        though I've struggled to combine both cultures in my day-to-day personality.
